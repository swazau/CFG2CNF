COMPARISON OF ORIGINAL VS STEP-BY-STEP CONVERSION

ORIGINAL GRAMMAR:
S -> X | Y
X -> xX | xZ
Y -> yY | yZ
Z -> abcM
M -> NP
N -> n | $
P -> p | $

ORIGINAL VERSION RESULT:
A -> y
B -> x
C -> a
D -> b
E -> c
F -> n
G -> p
H -> DEM
M -> NP | F | G
N -> F
P -> G
S -> AY | AZ | BX | BZ
X -> BX | BZ
Y -> AY | AZ
Z -> CH

STEP-BY-STEP VERSION RESULT:
A -> y
B -> x
C -> a
D -> b
E -> c
F -> n
G -> p
H -> DJ
I -> DE
J -> EM
M -> NP | n | p
N -> n
P -> p
S -> AY | AZ | BX | BZ
X -> BX | BZ
Y -> AY | AZ
Z -> CH | CI

DIFFERENCES ANALYSIS:
1. Both versions create similar terminal mappings (A->y, B->x, etc.)
2. The step-by-step version has additional non-terminals I and J created during breakdown
3. The step-by-step version keeps the original terminal rules (M -> n | p, N -> n, P -> p) 
   rather than substituting with non-terminals (M -> F | G, N -> F, P -> G)
4. The original version has H -> DEM while step-by-step breaks it down further: H -> DJ, J -> EM
5. The step-by-step version has Z -> CH | CI, adding the CI rule from breaking down Z -> CDE
6. Both versions handle the main structure similarly for S, X, and Y productions
